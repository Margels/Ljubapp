      Listen and watch carefully: <strong>your opponents has been dropping hints here and there about what will happen next</strong>! Use this information to answer the question below and win 5 points 🔮 <br><br>
      Careful, though: some of those hints might be lies or intentionally misleading! If you guess wrong, your opponent will earn 5 points! <br><br>
      But worry not: there is also one answer, among the options, that is close to the correct one. If you choose the close answer, both of you will earn <strong>2 points</strong>. <br><br>
      Good luck, Oracle!
