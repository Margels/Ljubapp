    <p class="description">
      Listen and watch carefully: <strong>your opponents has been dropping hints here and there so you can predict the future</strong>strong> and will continue to do so! 🔮 <br><br>
      Careful, though: some of them might be lies or intentionally misleading! <br><br>
      Use your mastermind to answer the question below: you will win <strong>5 points</strong> each time you guess. If you fail, though, your opponent earns 5 points! <br><br>
      But worry not: there is also one answer, among the options, that is close to the correct one. If you choose the close answer, both of you will earn <strong>2 points</strong>. <br><br>
      Good luck, Oracle!
