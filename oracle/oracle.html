    <h1>Predict the Future</h1>

    <p class="description">
      Listen and watch carefully: your opponents has been dropping hints here and there so you can predict the future and will continue to do so!
      <br><br>
      Careful, though: some of them might be lies or intentionally misleading.
      Use your mastermind to answer the question below and win <strong>5 points</strong> for each time you guess!
      <br><br>
      If you fail, your opponent earns 5 points.
      <br><br>
      But worry not: if you get close to the answer, both of you will earn <strong>2 points</strong>.
      Good luck, Oracle!
